# Python_Flask_BackEnd
This is a Python Flask RESTful API via which anyone can send feedback for a specific product. So far, there are only 2 products in the database: The "abc" (Product ID '0815') and the "xyz" (Product ID '1337'). Every feedback consists of a numeral rating (between 1 and 5 stars) and an optional comment, name and email address. Administrators can able to view how many feedback answers were given per rating (e.g. 3 users voted 1 star, 10 user voted 2 stars, etc.) in a selectable time-frame. To access this information, the administrators can request the API via HTTP Basic authentication, using their personal username and password.
